# üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è QueryHunt - SQL Murder Mystery Game

**QueryHunt** is an interactive SQL game that combines the excitement of a murder mystery with the power of AI. Inspired by the original SQL Murder Mystery, this project challenges players to solve a unique case by running SQL queries against AI-generated data. Built as a hackathon project for TiDB, QueryHunt showcases the capabilities of TiDB Serverless, GPT-4, and other modern technologies.

## Features

- **Engaging Gameplay:** Players use SQL queries to explore data and identify the murderer in a dynamically generated story.
- **AI-Powered Hints:** An AI assistant provides hints based on previous queries to guide players toward the correct solution.
- **Modern Tech Stack:** The game leverages TiDB Serverless, GPT-4o mini, and open-source libraries to deliver a smooth and modern experience.
- **Scalable and Unique:** Each game session is unique, with new stories and data generated every time, ensuring a fresh challenge for every player.

## Tech Stack

- **TiDB Serverless:** Stores AI-generated temporary game data, including tables for Victim, Suspects, Evidence, Alibis, and more.
- **TiDB VectorSearch:** Ensures the AI generates valid SQL queries by referencing schema embeddings stored in the vs_game_schema table.
- **Llama-Index:** Manages the workflow for generating and validating game data, including self-healing processes.
- **OpenAI:** GPT-4o mini model generates unique game stories, data and personalized hints for a player.
- **Streamlit:** Provides the user interface, including a custom SQL editor for running queries.

## How It Works

1. **Story Generation:** The AI generates a unique murder mystery story and populates the database with relevant data.
2. **Data Exploration:** Players explore the data by running SQL queries to piece together the clues and identify the murderer.
3. **Hints System:** The AI can offer hints based on the player‚Äôs query history, helping them narrow down the suspects.
4. **Victory:** The game ends when the player correctly identifies the murderer.
